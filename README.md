# baseball_portfolio
Collection of baseball projects with the objectives of learning, practicing, and demonstrating coding. Each project is described below and corresponds to a R and R Markdown file above. 

## Project 1: Statcast

This code uses the baseballr package's statcast_search() function. The function on its own returns pitch-by-pitch metrics from a given date range, but it cannot handle the payload of an entire season's worth of data. Therefore, this code loops the function through every day in a given season. The resulting data tables from this code allow for a wide span of analyses.

## Project 2: LeMahieu Fastball Types
