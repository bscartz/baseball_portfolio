    "# ChatGPT for Box Scores\n",

    "Purpose: to answer questions and provide summative information about recent games or series from around baseball.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program takes inputs of box scores and answers questions regarding noteworthy events from the games described. The box scores could be from around the MLB, minor leagues, or college baseball. It is not meant to provide in-depth analysis, but it can be an effective tool in keeping scouts, managers, and executives informed about the volume of games that they are unable to watch. The program takes an optional input of a pre-defined watchlist, which allows the user to request information about a particular selection of players. It can also be systematized to provide weekly updates of notable performances that might otherwise go unnoticed."
